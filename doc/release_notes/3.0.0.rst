Added

* Add field setters and getters to ``RegisterCppGenerator``.
* Add ``*_MASK_INVERSE`` defines for fields to ``RegisterCGenerator``.
* Add support for register constants of boolean and floating point type.

Breaking changes

* Remove the field ``_mask`` and ``_shift`` public constants from the generated C++
  interface header.
  These are not needed now that setters and getters are available.
* Change to use unresolved VHDL types in ``RegisterVhdlGenerator`` class.

  * ``std_ulogic_vector`` instead of ``std_logic_vector``.
  * ``u_signed`` instead of ``signed``.
  * ``u_unsigned`` instead of ``unsigned``.

Changes

* Increase TOML parsing performance by using ``tomli`` Python package instead of ``tomlkit``.
